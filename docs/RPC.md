# TokenPlay RPC Proposal

The eWallet team is fairly comfortable with the proposal by TheJibe regarding the Backend Endpoints required by the TokenPlay frontend written in Electron JS & React. However, there was one area of the proposal that we would like to change. We believe that we should be as fault tolerant and protocol agnostic as possible and are proposing an RPC system for the entire API.
