  Bcrypt password hashing library main module.

  ## Bcrypt

  Bcrypt is a key derivation function for passwords designed by Niels Provos
  and David MaziÃ¨res. Bcrypt is an adaptive function, which means that it can
  be configured to remain slow and resistant to brute-force attacks even as
  computational power increases.

  ## Bcrypt versions

  This bcrypt implementation is based on the latest OpenBSD version, which
  fixed a small issue that affected some passwords longer than 72 characters.
  By default, it produces hashes with the prefix `$2b$`, and it can check
  hashes with either the `$2b$` prefix or the older `$2a$` prefix.
  It is also possible to generate hashes with the `$2a$` prefix by running
  the following command:

      Bcrypt.Base.hash_password("hard to guess", Bcrypt.gen_salt(12, true))

  This option should only be used if you need to generate hashes that are
  then checked by older libraries.
  """

  alias Bcrypt.Base

  @doc """
  Generate a salt for use with the `Bcrypt.Base.hash_password` function.

  The log_rounds parameter determines the computational complexity
  of the generation of the password hash. Its default is 12, the minimum is 4,
  and the maximum is 31.

  The `legacy` option is for generating salts with the old `$2a$` prefix.
  Only use this option if you need to generate hashes that are then checked
  by older libraries.

  Hash the password with a salt which is randomly generated.

  ## Configurable parameters

  The following parameter can be set in the config file:

    * log_rounds - computational cost
      * the number of log rounds
      * 12 (2^12 rounds) is the default

  If you are hashing passwords in your tests, it can be useful to add
  the following to the `config/test.exs` file:

      config :bcrypt_elixir,
        log_rounds: 4

  NB. do not use this value in production.

  ## Options

  There is one option (this can be used if you want to override the
  value in the config):

    * log_rounds - the number of log rounds
      * the amount of computation, given in number of iterations
